The book was originally published in Russian and has been translated into English by N. A. Silverman. It is suitable for students and teachers of mathematics who want to improve their skills and knowledge in mathematical analysis. The book is available for free download from the Internet Archive[^1^]. You can also buy a paperback version from Amazon or other online retailers.
 
Whether you want to prepare for exams, test your understanding of concepts, or challenge yourself with some interesting and stimulating problems, *A Collection of Problems on a Course of Mathematical Analysis* by G. N. Berman is a valuable resource that you can use.

Mathematical analysis is not only a theoretical subject, but also has many applications in various fields of science and engineering. Some examples of these applications are:
 
- **Electromagnetics analysis** for detection by radar[^4^]
- **Material constitutive modeling and equation of state** for describing the behavior of solids and fluids under stress[^4^]
- **Underwater acoustic signal processing** for communication and navigation in the ocean[^4^]
- **Predicting the evolution of crystals** growing in an industrial crystallizer using partial differential equations and numerical methods[^4^]
- **Analytic number theory** for cryptography and security of data transmission[^2^]
- **Applied mathematics** for modeling and solving problems in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and social sciences[^2^]

These are just some of the many examples of how mathematical analysis can be used to understand and improve the world around us.

If you are interested in learning more about mathematical analysis, there are many books that you can consult. Some of the best mathematical analysis books of all time are:

1. **Principles of Mathematical Analysis** by Walter Rudin. This classic text covers the basic topics of real and complex analysis, such as metric spaces, sequences and series, differentiation, integration, and function spaces. It is known for its clear and concise style, rigorous proofs, and challenging exercises.
2. **Real and Complex Analysis** by Walter Rudin. This is a more advanced text that builds on the previous one and explores topics such as measure theory, Lebesgue integration, harmonic analysis, analytic functions, and conformal mapping. It is also praised for its elegance and clarity.
3. **A Course in Mathematical Analysis** by D. J. H. Garling. This is a three-volume set that covers real analysis, complex analysis, and multivariate analysis. It is aimed at undergraduate students who want to learn the essential concepts and techniques of analysis. It is written in a friendly and accessible manner, with many examples and exercises.

These are just some of the many books that you can use to study mathematical analysis. You can also find online resources, such as lectures, notes, videos, and tutorials, that can help you learn this fascinating subject.
